General Information:

This project was created for CS 465 â€“ Cybersecurity Principles and Practice by Brenden Blake and Elizabeth Lowe. 

The intended purpose of this project is to to implement a program that manages and enforces an access control policy represented by an access control matrix (ACM) using the capabilities approach.

Using the interface, users will be able to load ACM entries, print the ACM, update the entries from a file, and evaluate access requests from a file. 

Languages Used:

Java

Text Files Needed: 

The user is able to input three different files in the program:
  * A file loading entries into the ACM
  * A file with sample requests to check in the ACM
  * A file with updated entries for the ACM

Set Up:

Ensure that all three text files, Main.java, AccessControl.java, and FileNode.java are in the same directory. 

How to run:

* Run Main.java
* A menu of options will appear and from there the user can interact with the program by following the instructions from the menu.
